This project focus on exploring the impact of sensational events on the sentiment index. The dataset is millions of Weibo text data. To construct sentiment index for specific topics, sentiment classification model, word vector embedding and clustering methods were applied. After that, a difference in difference model was applied to empirically analyze the impact of sensational events on the sentiment index of different topics. It turned out that COVID-19â€™s impact on shopping, life, and epidemic-related topics is greater than that on other topics. At the same time, to a certain degree, the shopping sentiment index can reflect the volatility of the Shanghai composite index and can be used for monitoring the market index.
